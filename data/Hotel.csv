That little gesture was just the beginning of the incredible service ahead.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention to the hosts at the executive lounge: Blanche, Cecile, and Carina who really went out of their way to make us feel welcome.

Coffee was bitter, burnt and undrinkable so we opted for tea. Bread supplied with the omelette was not toasted, and was dry and stale. We understand that the remoteness of this resort may mean that getting fresh supplies in is an extra challenge, but we would have appreciated more local foods, and fresh juices. Fresh fruits were often small samples of mango, ladyfinger banana and watermelon, and on our last day we were given two slices of apple that had been cut earlier and were brown.
